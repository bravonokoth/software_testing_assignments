## Different Types of Software Testing and Their Significance
Software testing can be compared to a health check-up for software before it is released. Each type of testing plays a specific role — like different doctors focusing on different parts of a patient’s health.

** Unit Testing – Checks individual components of the software in isolation, ensuring each part works as intended.

** Integration Testing – Verifies that different components interact correctly when combined.

** System Testing – Evaluates the entire application as a complete product to ensure it functions properly in a production-like environment.

** Acceptance Testing – Confirms that the software meets the end user’s requirements and expectations.

**Significance:
  Testing allows a team to identify and fix bugs, performance issues, or security risks early, reducing the cost and effort required later in development.


## Functional vs Non-Functional Testing
** Functional testing focuses on what the software does, while non-functional testing focuses on how well it performs.


** Functional Testing – Ensures the software’s features work according to requirements. For example:

** Can a user log in with correct credentials?

** Does the “Search” button return the correct results?

** Non-Functional Testing – Measures the software’s performance, usability, and reliability. For example:

## How fast does a page load?

  Can the system handle heavy traffic?

  In short: Functional = What it does, Non-functional = How well it does it.

  | **Aspect**  | **Unit Testing** 🧩                                                     | **Integration Testing** 🔗                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**   | Tests small, individual pieces of code (functions, classes, or modules) | Tests the interaction between multiple components                                |
| **Purpose** | Ensures each component works correctly on its own                       | Ensures combined components work correctly together                              |
| **Example** | Checking if a “calculateTotal()” function returns the correct sum       | Checking if “calculateTotal()” works properly when linked with “applyDiscount()” |

## System Testing & Acceptance Testing
** System Testing – Tests the complete application in an environment similar to production to ensure all features work together.

** Acceptance Testing – Conducted to determine whether the software meets the agreed requirements before it is released to users.

## Role in quality:

** System Testing ensures the product is fully functional and stable.

** Acceptance Testing ensures the product is ready and approved for use.


## Common Types of Non-Functional Testing
   These tests evaluate the quality attributes of a system:

**  Performance Testing – Measures speed and responsiveness under expected load.

** Load Testing – Checks behavior under a specific volume of users or transactions.

** Stress Testing – Pushes the system beyond normal limits to see how it recovers.

** Security Testing – Identifies vulnerabilities to protect against cyberattacks.

** Usability Testing – Ensures the system is intuitive and easy for users.

** Compatibility Testing – Verifies operation across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.
